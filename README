heaping

This program takes a list of IP addresses on the command line and sends
an ICMP echo request to each one every 10 seconds. For each response, it
prints the response time in ms (or "unreachable"). It does nothing else.

It was written to monitor the reachability of a large number of hosts
in conjunction with rrdtool or something similar.
